            <h2>My Hacktoberfest story: </h2>
            <p>This is my second year in Hacktoberfest.<br> I like how big organisations encourage newbies to get into coding and help other people as well and have keen interest in web-development.<br> I have even done some small projects on this domain. I have also participated in a lot of competitions and like to learn anything new. </p>
            <h2>My motivation: </h2>
            <p>Being able to replicate websites that we use in day-to-day lives<br> and knowing what happens behind the scenes after learning about web-development is what amuses me. </p>  
            <br>
            <h2 id="Text">So Friends! Go ahead with your coding journey and enjoy this power of creation!</h2>
