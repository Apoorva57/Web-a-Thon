        I am Vidushi Tomar, a MERN stack web-developer. I am a final year B.Tech Computer Science & Engineeering student. I work with C++, python, node.js, javascript, Drupal8, express.js, react.js. I really like to take new challenges and learn new skills while completing them. Basically my way of learning is to learn while doing and repeating. 
    <br><br>
    I never had interest in DS & Algo but during my journey I came to know that they are really important. Even if you are a web-developer ,directly of indirectly you use them. To put the correct logic it is required.
