	<p id="p1">Helloooo!!! Hover over these paragraphs to see the full text and a bit of functionality :)</p>

	<p id="p2"> I allways liked the feeling of making something work, either if I made it from scratch, or fixed some existing issue...
	Haven't done it yet, but I am excited to change my career to web design :)</p>

	<p id="p3">After I will do web design for a while, I think I will like even more going towards game development, I'm talking triple AAA kind of games</p>

	<p id="p4" onmouseover="alo();">Anyway, I think it will be a super experience knowing that I took part in some huge fulfilling project that (why not) can make the world a better place or help someone become a better version of themselves. Thanks for taking the time to read that, I wish YOU a sooperdooper nice day!</p>
