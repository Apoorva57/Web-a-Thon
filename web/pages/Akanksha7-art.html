    <p>
      I have started my journey in coding in my first year of college.<br /> I started
      it with learning basics of languages like C and C++. Then started solving
      some problems in common coding websites like Hackerrank, hackerearth etc.
      I also started to learn basic web development stuffs.<br /> Then I got
      interested into android app development. I along with one of my friend
      participated in one coding competition.<br /> We successfully developed the app
      and also secured 3rd postion. Then I Started to focus more on Data
      structures and algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days I'm trying to improve my coding skills by learing new
      programming languages and exploring new tech stacks.
