<body>I started off learning HTML from about 12 years old by reading the source code from websites that I liked. HTML seemed quite straightforward. I was doing just the basic pages -- think of your typical 1990's style websites -- with some rather wild backgrounds, many horizontal rules and what teenager's website would be complete without a guestbook? ;)
<br/>
Soon, I picked up some javascript and annoyed people with many of those pop-up message boxes. I was a teenager, keep that in mind! This was all back in the days before MySpace and Facebook when us kids of the internet age sought to express ourselves by making websites about ourselves, our hobbies or even just our everyday musings and putting them up on Geocities or Angelfire.
<br/>
Websites have advanced so much since then. They've become so media-rich and dynamic. But every now and then, I'll stumble across a still-maintained site that looks like it was born in the early 90's and it just gives me that nostalgic, warm and fuzzy feeling. :)
