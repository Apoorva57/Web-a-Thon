            <p>
                I am from Brazil and I graduated in 2010 in the area of â€‹â€‹computing and in my course I fell in love with
                programming.
                I started from there to create static, dynamic websites, to play with databases.
            </p>
            <p> But I had to take a break from my fun because I had 2 children. After 7 years stopped, i came back and
                to my
                surprise wow!ðŸ¤©
                Everything changed in the world of the web, the way of developing, the way of saving data, the world of
                frameworks
                and I fell in love again ... this time even more excited about everything that has changed for the
                better.
            </p>
            <p>I hope to learn and help people get started in the world of programming and
                I feel very grateful for everyone who has taught me so far.</p>
