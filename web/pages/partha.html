        <h3>How has Coding Changed My Life ? </h3>
        <p>Well most of us are creative in some way or the other and coding has helped me to understand that I possess logic based creativity and that's the way it helps to me solve real world problems in a short and easy way. It has developed a great depth of creativity and it helps my mind to stay busy and my only source to be innovative in the things I do.Initially I worked as a software tester but due to my love for developing and exploring my own skills I have sqitched over to the DevOps role and has helped me to understand the whole SDLC much better from development to testing and deployment.</p>
        <p>Some of the programming languages and tools related to Devops that I know:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>NodeJS</li>
          <li>Docker</li>
          <li>Go Lang</li>
          <li>ANsible</li>
        </ul>
